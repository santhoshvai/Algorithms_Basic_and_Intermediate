Programming Assignment 2: Randomized Queues and Deques


## Programming Assignment 2: Randomized Queues and Deques

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

**Dequeue.** A _double-ended queue_ or _deque_ (pronounced "deck") is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports inserting and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. Create a generic data type `Deque` that implements the following API:

>
>     **public class Deque implements Iterable {**
>     **   public Deque()                           **// construct an empty deque
>     **   public boolean isEmpty()                 **// is the deque empty?
>     **   public int size()                        **// return the number of items on the deque
>     **   public void addFirst(Item item)          **// insert the item at the front
>     **   public void addLast(Item item)           **// insert the item at the end
>     **   public Item removeFirst()                **// delete and return the item at the front
>     **   public Item removeLast()                 **// delete and return the item at the end
>     **   public Iterator iterator()         **// return an iterator over items in order from front to end
>     **   public static void main(String[] args)   **// unit testing
>     **}**
>

Throw a `NullPointerException` if the client attempts to add a null item; throw a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` if the client attempts to remove an item from an empty deque; throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if the client calls the `remove()` method in the iterator; throw a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` if the client calls the `next()` method in the iterator and there are no more items to return.

Your deque implementation must support each deque operation in _constant worst-case time_ and use space proportional to the number of items _currently_ in the deque. Additionally, your iterator implementation must support the operations `next()` and `hasNext()` (plus construction) in constant worst-case time and use a constant amount of extra space per iterator.

**Randomized queue.** A _randomized queue_ is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure. Create a generic data type `RandomizedQueue` that implements the following API:

>
>     **public class RandomizedQueue implements Iterable {**
>     **   public RandomizedQueue()                 **// construct an empty randomized queue
>     **   public boolean isEmpty()                 **// is the queue empty?
>     **   public int size()                        **// return the number of items on the queue
>     **   public void enqueue(Item item)           **// add the item
>     **   public Item dequeue()                    **// delete and return a random item
>     **   public Item sample()                     **// return (but do not delete) a random item
>     **   public Iterator iterator()         **// return an independent iterator over items in random order
>     **   public static void main(String[] args)   **// unit testing
>     **}**
>

Throw a `NullPointerException` if the client attempts to add a null item; throw a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` if the client attempts to sample or dequeue an item from an empty randomized queue; throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if the client calls the `remove()` method in the iterator; throw a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` if the client calls the `next()` method in the iterator and there are no more items to return.

Your randomized queue implementation must support each randomized queue operation (besides creating an iterator) in _constant amortized time_ and use space proportional to the number of items _currently_ in the queue. That is, any sequence of _M_ randomized queue operations (starting from an empty queue) should take at most _cM_ steps in the worst case, for some constant _c_. Additionally, your iterator implementation must support construction in time linear in the number of items and it must support the operations `next()` and `hasNext()` in constant worst-case time; you may use a linear amount of extra memory per iterator. The order of two or more iterators to the same randomized queue should be _mutually independent_; each iterator must maintain its own random order.

**Subset client.** Write a client program `Subset.java` that takes a command-line integer _k_; reads in a sequence of _N_ strings from standard input using `StdIn.readString()`; and prints out exactly _k_ of them, uniformly at random. Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most once. You may assume that _k_ â‰¥ 0 and no greater than the number of string _N_ on standard input.

>     G                                              AA
>     A                                              BB
>                                                    CC
>     % **echo A B C D E F G H I | java Subset 3**       BB
>     E                                              BB
>     F                                              CC
>     G                                              BB

The running time of `Subset` must be linear in the size of the input. You may use only a constant amount of memory plus either one `Deque` or `RandomizedQueue` object of maximum size at most _N_, where _N_ is the number of strings on standard input. (For an extra challenge, use only one `Deque` or `RandomizedQueue` object of maximum size at most _k_.) It should have the following API.

>
>     **public class Subset {**
>     **   public static void main(String[] args)**
>     **}**
>

**Deliverables.** Submit only `Deque.java`, `RandomizedQueue.java`, and `Subset.java`. We will supply `stdlib.jar`. You may not call any library functions other than those in `java.lang` and `stdlib.jar`.
